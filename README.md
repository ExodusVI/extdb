# IMPORTANT UPCOMING BATTLEYE CHANGES  
Will prevent extensions from beening run on client i.e like Arma2.  
extDB2 will be whitelisted, extDB will not be whitelisted.  

If you are running a headless client, now is the time to update your mission.  


## No Longer Maintained...  
Offical Development is now at http://github.com/Torndeco/extDB2  
  
  
  
extDB2 is very similiar but it is not compatiable with extDB.  
If your mission/mod is still using extDB you need to update it.  


##### extDB has known bugs that can and will crash armaserver  
##### These bugs are fixed in extDB2
