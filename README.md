## No Longer Maintained...  
Offical Development is now at http://github.com/Torndeco/extDB2  
extDB2 is very similiar but it is not compatiable with extDB.  
If your mission/mod is still using extDB you need to update it.  


##### extDB has known bugs that can and will crash armaserver  
##### These bugs are fixed in extDB2
