Offical Development is now on https://github.com/Torndeco/extDB2  
Note extDB2 is very similiar but it is not back compatiable extDB.  
So if your mission is still using extDB you need to update it  


## Also extDB has known bugs that can + will crash armaserver  
## These bugs are fixed in extDB2
