## No Longer Maintained...  
Offical Development is now on https://github.com/Torndeco/extdb2  
Note extDB2 is very similiar but not back compatiable extDB.  
It will require changes to SQF Code + DB_CUSTOM File.

#### Using Fred's Malloc
extDB is incompatible with https://github.com/fred41/tbbmalloc_arma.  
   Workaround rename Fred's malloc & change arma startup to the new filename.
